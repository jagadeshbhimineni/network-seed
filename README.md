### Why do we need this environment
- Creating A Hands-On environment for practical learning of different mechanisms within the classroom, fostering practice environments, and implementing defensive mechanisms against cyberattacks can create a network security lab to fortify information safety and ensure heightened confidentiality measures.


- This environment provides us with the capability to perform a range of testing procedures, including but not limited to, testing `IP` addresses via `HTTP` requests, conducting network protocol testing like `TCP`, `ICMP`, `ARP`, `etc`,  and monitoring and manipulating data packets.

#### Another way to set up the environment
- Another choice we have for creating the environment is to use `Seed-Lab` from GitHub, but it requires a `virtual machine` with an `Ubuntu` environment and is quite heavy.
  #### What is `seed`
  - As `seed` is the username, you are free to use any other name you choose.

#### How to set up
- The setup instructions as well as the system and environment requirements are located in the source script directory.

#### Why do we need this setup instead of Seed-VDI, which is already available
- This is an alternative method to set up the environment for the **Networking lab**. With `Seed-Lab`Setup, we receive a `VDI` file that needs to be set up through a `virtual machine`, which can be a heavy process. However, we are offering a similar environment setup that is much lighter and quicker to set up locally, **without requiring any additional applications** like a `virtual machine`. **Additionally, this same environment can also be set up in cloud machines**
